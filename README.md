# Phishing Link Scanner üîóüõ°Ô∏è

A Python-based **Phishing Link Scanner** that analyzes URLs for suspicious patterns and provides feedback on their safety. It integrates **basic URL checks** with an optional **VirusTotal API** query for deeper threat analysis.

---

## Features üåü

1. **Basic URL Analysis**:
   - Detects suspicious characters (e.g., `@`, `-`) or long subdomains.
   - Flags phishing-related keywords like `login`, `free`, `secure`, etc.
   - Warns if the URL does not use HTTPS.

2. **VirusTotal Integration** *(Optional)*:
   - Queries VirusTotal's API for URL reputation analysis.
   - Displays the number of detections reported (requires a free API key).

3. **Interactive and User-Friendly**:
   - Provides clear warnings and safe messages using **color-coded output**.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.7+** is required.
2. Install the required libraries:

## Usage üöÄ

### Run the Scanner
1. Launch the program:
   ```bash
   python phishing_link_scanner.py
   ```
2. Enter the URL you want to analyze when prompted.

### Example

Enter the URL to check: http://free-login.secure-bank-example.com

[!] Keyword 'login' found in URL. Could be phishing!
[!] URL does not use HTTPS. It might not be secure.
[!] URL might be a phishing link! Proceed with caution.

Do you want to query VirusTotal for deeper analysis? (yes/no): yes
[‚úì] VirusTotal shows no detections for the URL.
```

## VirusTotal API Integration üîç

To use the VirusTotal integration:
1. Sign up for an API key on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us).
2. Replace the placeholder in the code:
   ```python
   API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   ```

## Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è

- [ ] Add support for other threat intelligence APIs (e.g., Google Safe Browsing, PhishTank).
- [ ] Build a GUI using Tkinter or PyQt for easier interaction.
- [ ] Implement machine learning models for phishing detection.
- [ ] Enhance reporting with logs and visualization tools.
